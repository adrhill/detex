"""Handler for the ``platform_index`` primitive.

``platform_index`` returns a scalar i32 indicating which platform is active.
It takes no inputs and its output is fully determined at runtime,
so all dependency sets are empty.

No ``const_vals`` tracking is needed,
because the value is platform-dependent and unknown at trace time.

Jaxpr:
    invars: [] (no inputs)
    outvars: [scalar i32]
    params: platforms (tuple of platform strings)
